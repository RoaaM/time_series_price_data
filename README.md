Data Handling and Analysis:

## In This Notebook:
I have meticulously handled and analyzed this time series price dataset to uncover meaningful insights, patterns, and trends. Time series data often requires specialized techniques for preprocessing and analysis, such as trend analysis, seasonality detection, and forecasting.

### Dashboard Creation:

In an effort to make this dataset more accessible and user-friendly, I have designed and implemented a dashboard. This dashboard includes interactive visualizations and summaries that allow for a better understanding of the time series data. Users can explore the historical price trends, identify key turning points, and gain insights into potential future price movements.

Feel free to utilize this dataset and interact with the dashboard to explore historical price behavior, identify seasonality or trends, and make informed decisions based on the valuable insights derived from this time series data.
